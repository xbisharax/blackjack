# blackjack
purpose:  Java program to simulate a blackjack game of cards. The computer will
    play the role of the dealer. The program will randomly generate the cards 
    dealt to the player and dealer during the game. Cards in this game will be 
    represented by numbers 1 to 13 with Ace being represented by a 1. Face cards 
    (i.e. Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points to a hand while an Ace can
    be worth 1 or 11 points depending on the userâ€™s choice. The numbered cards 
    are worth their number value to the hand.
